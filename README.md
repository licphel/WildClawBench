> **Hard, practical, end-to-end evaluation for AI agents — in the wild.**

---

**WildClawBench** is an agent benchmark that tests what actually matters: can an AI agent do real work, end-to-end, without hand-holding?

We drop agents into a live [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) environment — the same open-source personal AI assistant that real users rely on daily — and throw **60 original tasks** at them: clipping goal highlights from a football match, negotiating meeting times over multi-round emails, hunting down contradictions in search results, writing inference scripts for undocumented codebases, catching privacy leaks before they happen. Useful things. Hard things.

In the **technical report snapshot**, the strongest frontier model topped out at **62.2% overall**; the latest audited OpenClaw runs have since raised the best score to **67.2%**. Most models still land well below that. That makes scores mean something.

### Why WildClawBench?

Most agent benchmarks test isolated capabilities — calling a function, parsing JSON, following a single instruction. WildClawBench tests the full picture:

| | What We Test | Why It's Hard |
|:---:|---|---|
| **🔗 Agency** | Multi-step tool orchestration, error recovery, autonomous planning | Agents must chain 10–60+ tool calls, adapt when services fail, and decide *what* to do — not just *how* |
| **🎥 Multimodal** | Video understanding, image generation, cross-modal synthesis | Track events across a 45-min match video and clip precise highlights; classify 12 clothing photos, assemble 4 styled outfits, and generate full-body model images for each |
| **🧵 Long-Horizon** | Complex workflows spanning 10–20 minutes of wall-clock execution | Negotiate meeting times over multiple email rounds; crawl, classify, and summarize 50+ academic papers |
| **💻 Coding** | Read undocumented codebases, debug, generate working programs | Read an undocumented codebase, install dependencies, and write working inference from source alone; solve visual puzzles by generating pixel-accurate solutions |
| **🛡️ Safety** | Prompt injection defense, credential leak detection, harmful content refusal | Harmful instructions are buried deep inside normal-looking documents; API keys are scattered across a large git history |

### What Sets Us Apart

- **Real environment, not mocks.** Tasks run inside a live OpenClaw instance with real tools (browser, bash, file system, email, calendar).
- **60 original tasks, built by hand.** Not adapted from existing benchmarks — each task was designed from scratch to stress-test real-world agent capabilities.
- **Five agent harnesses, one task suite.** OpenClaw, Claude Code, Codex CLI, Hermes Agent, and Perdura (PyLM) execute the same task suite under the same grading. This separates *model capability* from *harness scaffolding* — you can see how much an agent's score depends on its surrounding tools versus the underlying LLM.
- **Reproducible & isolated.** Each task runs in its own Docker container. Same image, same data, same grading code. Ground truth and grading scripts are injected only after the agent finishes — they are never visible during execution, eliminating data leakage. Scores are reproducible across machines.

## Leaderboard

WildClawBench reports two complementary leaderboards:

1. **Model leaderboard (OpenClaw harness)** — apples-to-apples comparison of LLMs running inside the same OpenClaw harness.
2. **Harness comparison** — same model and tasks across the configured agent scaffolds.

Full interactive leaderboard at [internlm.github.io/WildClawBench](https://internlm.github.io/WildClawBench/).

### Model leaderboard (OpenClaw harness)

> **Overall score** follows the weighted Multimodal / Pure-text breakdown in that table. **Total time** and **total cost** are the paper’s Overall per-task averages (minutes / USD) multiplied by **60** for the full 60-task suite.

## Quick Start

### Install Docker

<details>
<summary>macOS</summary>

```bash
brew install --cask docker
```

After installation, launch Docker Desktop from Applications or run:

```bash
open -a Docker
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Ubuntu</summary>

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg

# Add Docker's official GPG key
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Add apt repository
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Install Docker
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

# Allow current user to run Docker without sudo
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

</details>

### Download Images

The repository runner uses **five** pinned Docker images, one per harness. The current tags are recorded in `eval_framework/baseline_verifier/wildclawbench/runner_config.json`; verify that those exact tags exist on the machine running the benchmark before starting a run.

| Harness | Pinned image tag |
|---|---|
| OpenClaw | `wildclawbench-openclaw-ubuntu:v2026.9.1-grader` |
| Claude Code | `wildclawbench-claudecode-ubuntu:v2.1.263-grader` |
| Codex CLI | `wildclawbench-codex-ubuntu:v0.153.4-grader` |
| Hermes Agent | `wildclawbench-hermes-agent:v0.21.0-grader` |
| Perdura / PyLM | `wildclawbench-perdura-ubuntu:v0.5` |

Image build/load is an infrastructure step maintained with the baseline
verifier. Do not silently substitute an older tag: the launcher passes the
exact configured tag and the corresponding backend fails fast if its canonical
image variable is absent.

### Download Task Data

Download the task data from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/internlm/WildClawBench/tree/main/workspace):

```bash
hf download internlm/WildClawBench workspace --repo-type dataset --local-dir .
```

### Prepare Data

Run the preparation script to download YouTube videos, place them into the correct task directories, and extract archived git repos:

```bash
bash script/prepare.sh
```

The script will:
- Download 3 YouTube videos (football match, lecture, product launch event)
- Extract the first half of the football match and discard the full video
- Rename and copy videos to the directories that need them
- Extract `dot_git.tar.gz` for Safety Alignment tasks
- Download SAM3 model weights for Code Intelligence tasks


Prerequisites: `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`, `gdown`.

> **Note:** YouTube downloads may require authentication. If you encounter a "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" error, try one of the following:
> - [Get cookies.txt locally](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc?pli=1).
> - Use `--cookies-from-browser` (e.g., `--cookies-from-browser chrome`)
> - Install [Deno](https://deno.land/) as a JS engine, which some users have reported resolves the issue

### Run

Set your API keys in the `.env` file:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_key_here  # required for search tasks
```

- **Inference gateway** — all five baselines use the per-experiment gateway. Its upstream defaults to the Codex OAuth route; configure a different upstream with `PYLM_INFERENCE_PROVIDER` when needed. A run is rejected if the gateway cannot be started or if it attempts to attach to a shared gateway.
- **Benchmark model** — fixed at `gpt-5.6-terra` for the alignment run. Model overrides are rejected so agent calls, image calls, side queries, and judges remain comparable.
- **Brave Search API Key** — Required for Search & Retrieval tasks. Get one (with free monthly credits) at [brave.com/search/api](https://brave.com/search/api/).
- **Judge model** — defaults to the same `gpt-5.6-terra` gateway model for this benchmark alignment.

Then use the unified entrypoint. Each invocation owns its output directory and gateway:

```bash
bash script/run.sh openclaw     --category all --parallel 4
bash script/run.sh claudecode   --category all --parallel 4
bash script/run.sh codex        --category all --parallel 4
bash script/run.sh hermesagent  --category all --parallel 4
bash script/run.sh pylm         --category all --parallel 4
```

Single-task runs are also supported:

```bash
bash script/run.sh openclaw --task tasks/06_Safety_Alignment/06_Safety_Alignment_task_1_file_overwrite.md
```

OpenClaw uses the internal model name `proxy/gpt-5.6-terra` only because its injected provider is named `proxy`. This is an OpenClaw configuration namespace, not the upstream model name: the gateway receives the bare `gpt-5.6-terra` id. The other four harnesses receive the same bare id.

### Provider and model alignment

The aligned runner owns provider routing. Keep the task suite and grader
unchanged; configure the gateway upstream through environment variables and
leave the benchmark model/image settings in `runner_config.json`. Direct
`eval/run_batch.py` invocations and custom model configs are for harness
development only and are not comparable benchmark runs.

## Check the Results

After the run completes, the aligned launcher closes the run manifest and moves
artifacts into `eval_results/wildclaw/<timestamp>-<baseline>/`. Each metric is
scored from `0.00` to `1.00`.

Per-task results retain the native harness shape below that run directory:

```
eval_results/wildclaw/<timestamp>-<baseline>/<harness>/<category>/<task_id>/
├── score.json          # per-metric scores
├── usage.json          # token counts, cost, elapsed time
├── agent.log           # agent execution log
├── chat.jsonl          # full conversation trace (OpenClaw)
├── claude_code_log/    # Claude Code session log (Claude Code)
├── codex_sessions/     # Codex session JSONLs (Codex)
├── gateway.log         # gateway log (OpenClaw)
└── task_output/        # files produced by the agent
```

The subdirectory name is `<short_model>_<timestamp>_<runid>`, where `short_model` is the last segment of the model path (for this alignment run, `gpt-5.6-terra`) and `runid` is a 6-char random hex string, so parallel or repeated runs never collide.

## Personal OpenClaw Evaluation

"Raising lobsters" has become a phenomenon — users gradually teach their OpenClaw agents new skills, customize personalities, and build up long-term memory through daily interaction. A natural question follows: **whose lobster is better?** Beyond bragging rights, there is real value in understanding which skill combinations, persona designs, and memory strategies actually improve agent performance on a given model. That's why we created the **Personal OpenClaw Leaderboard**. Submit your lobster's results and see how it stacks up!


```bash
python eval/run_batch.py \
    --category all --parallel 4 \
    --model openrouter/xx/xxx \
    --lobster-name your-lobster-name \
    --lobster-workspace /path/to/your/workspace
```

- `--lobster-name` — identifier, used in the output directory.
- `--lobster-workspace` — path to your OpenClaw workspace (containing `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `skills/`, etc.).
- `--lobster-env` — (optional) comma-separated env var names for skills that need API keys (e.g. `GEMINI_API_KEY,FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`). Add the actual values to `.env`.

After the run completes, send the following to **wildclawbench@proton.me**:

1. Your `output/summary_all_<lobster-name>_<model>.json`
2. (Optional) A brief description of how you trained your OpenClaw (e.g. key skills, custom SOUL.md, memory strategies).

We will update the leaderboard periodically.

## Cleanup

If a run is interrupted (e.g. `Ctrl+C`, terminal closed), some Docker containers may be left behind. To remove **all** WildClawBench containers when no tasks are running:

```bash
for img in \
    wildclawbench-openclaw-ubuntu:v2026.9.1-grader \
    wildclawbench-claudecode-ubuntu:v2.1.263-grader \
    wildclawbench-codex-ubuntu:v0.153.4-grader \
    wildclawbench-hermes-agent:v0.21.0-grader \
    wildclawbench-perdura-ubuntu:v0.5; do
  docker ps -a --filter "ancestor=$img" -q | xargs -r docker rm -f
done
```

To preview which containers would be removed (dry run), drop the `docker rm -f` step and use `--format "{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"`.
